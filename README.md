# AudioEmoDetect
The purpose of the project is to build a system that can identify the emotion of the speaker using the tone in the voice of the speaker. The model can recognize 6 different emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, Sadness, Surprise. The system can be used by artificial intelligence applications like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc. to assess the situation and support the user. It can be also used by the customer service network to understand the mood of the customer and give the respective automated replies. The aim of the project is to build multiple models using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and compare the different model accuracy and compare them with the state-of-the-art models.

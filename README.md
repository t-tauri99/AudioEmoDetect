# AudioEmoDetect
The Audio Emotion Detection System is a project designed to identify the speaker's emotion based on their voice tone. This system is capable of recognizing six different emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, Sadness, and Surprise. The primary goal is to create a versatile solution that can be integrated into artificial intelligence applications such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc., enhancing their ability to assess user emotions and respond accordingly.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques using popular libraries like TensorFlow to build and compare multiple models for emotion recognition. By evaluating the accuracy of these models, we aim to establish benchmarks and compare them with state-of-the-art models in the field.
